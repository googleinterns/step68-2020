      <p>Ever wondered what conditionals are? Let's dive in to understand 
        a fancy term given for what you already know.
      <p>Conditionals statements are features in computer science that
         your program decides to select.
         It's the same as selection conditions that you've been using in
         daily life.

      <p>For instance, there is an ice-cream truck in a park.
         What's the first question that comes to your mind? 
         Do I want an ice-cream? If you feel like having one, you will ask
         your parents to buy you one or you will decide may be next
         time. By setting two conditions--Want an ice-cream or not--you
         just used the if-else conditional statement. Now, if you decide to have an ice-cream, 
         you will have to use selection conditions again.
         What flavor do you want? If vanilla you have to pay $1.99, else if strawberry pay $0.99,
         else if vanilla with chocolate chip then pay $3.99, and so on.
     
      <p>Now, for computers to use similar workflow, programming languages--languages that are used
         to communicate with computer--use different types of conditional statements. For example,
         if, if else, switch, else if, et cetera. For now, let's play a quick game.
      <p>Suppose, There is a runaway trolley barreling down the railway tracks. 
         Ahead, on the tracks, there are five people tied up and unable to move. 
         The trolley is headed straight for them. You are standing some distance off in the train yard,
         next to a lever. What are the different selection situations that you can think of?
