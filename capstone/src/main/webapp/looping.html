      <p>I'm sure you've seen this symbol on many of your favorite websites and apps.
        It keeps moving the smaller circles in a circle until something is loaded or we exit.
        This is a prime example of looping! Looping allows us to do a certain task over and over and over
        (until we decide to stop it or it reaches a certain condition).
        We can also track what happens between each loop iteration!
      <p>In Computer Science, the two most common types of looping statements are <b>while
        loops</b> and <b>for loops</b>. <b>While loops</b> keep running a certain action
        <i>while</i> a certain condition is or is not met. <b>For loops</b> keep running
        a certain action while keeping count of how many times a certain action has
        ran with an iterator (or counter) variable.
