      <p>I'm sure you've seen this symbol on many of your favorite websites and apps.
        It keeps moving the smaller circles in a circle until something is loaded or we exit.
        This is a prime example of looping! Looping allows us to do a certain task over and over and over
        (until we decide to stop it or it reaches a certain condition).
        We can also track what happens between each loop iteration!

      <p>For example, let's track Stephen Curry's three-point attempts.
        Everytime Stephen Curry shoots from behind the three-point line and scores,
        he earns three points to his point total.
        Stephen Curry currently has six points. He takes five three-point shots and makes four of them.
        How many total points does Stephen Curry currently have?
      </p>

      <input type="radio" name="points" value="twelve">
      <label for="twelve">Twelve</label>
      <input type="radio" name="points" value="fourteen">
      <label for="fourteen">Fourteen</label>
      <input type="radio" name="points" value="eighteen" id="correct">
      <label for="eighteen">Eighteen</label>
      <input type="radio" name="points" value="ten">
      <label for="ten">Ten</label>

      <p id="right"><b>That is correct! Stephen Curry started with six points and made five three-pointers.
        By looping through each shot attempt he made, the point total ends up being eighteen points!</b></p>
      <p id="wrong"><b>Your answer is incorrect. Try again.</b></p>

      <p>In Computer Science, the two most common types of looping statements are <b>while
        loops</b> and <b>for loops</b>.
        <br>
        <b>While loops</b> keep running a certain action <i>while</i> a certain condition
        is or is not met.
        <br>
        <b>For loops</b> keep running a certain action <i>for</i> a certain duration,
        while internally keeping count of how many times it has ran with an iterator (or counter) variable.
        <br>
        Both of these looping statements are great to use, so it depends on
        your preference as to which one you want to use.
