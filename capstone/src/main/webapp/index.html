        <h2>Our goals:</h2>
        <p>
            Hello, and thank you for visiting ECS! ECS, or Elementary Computer Science, is a
            website designed to achieve two very important goals. The <b>first</b> is to teach the 
            fundamentals of Computer Science to kids at an early age. Many kids are not 
            introduced to computer science until college, at which point those who have never
            been introduced to these topics are significantly behind those who have. We at ECS
            believe that is unfair. For that reason, our <b>second</b> goal is to make this learning
            environment interactive and inclusive for all kids. We want to motivate as many people 
            with a computer science interest as we can. Any child, regardless of socioeconomic
            background, should have an equal opportunity to get involved with the computer science
            industy.
