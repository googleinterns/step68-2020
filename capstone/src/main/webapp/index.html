        <h2>Our goals:</h2>
        <p>
            Hello, and thank you for visiting ECS! ECS, or Elementary Computer Science, is a
            website designed to achieve two very important goals. The <b>first</b> is to teach the 
            fundamentals of Computer Science to kids at an early age. Many kids are not 
            introduced to computer science until college, at which point those who have never
            been introduced to these topics are significantly behind those who have. We at ECS
            believe that is unfair. For that reason, our <b>second</b> goal is to make this learning
            environment interactive and inclusive for all kids. We want to motivate as many people 
            with a computer science interest as we can. Any child, regardless of socioeconomic
            background, should have an equal opportunity to get involved with the computer science
            industy.
        </p>

        <h2>Achieving them:</h2>
        <p>
            We designed this website to be completely free and designed for all users. To achieve our 
            <b>second</b> goal we created a lesson plan in English, but using translation programs we 
            were able to create lesson plans in other languages as well. This means that children from 
            other countries and children with English as their second language will not only be able
            to use the site, but also ask for help from their parents when they don't understand a 
            concept. Although their parents may not know computer science, we designed this webste 
            to be easily understandable by all. Through content-specific lesson plans, we will achieve
            our <b>first</b> goal by teaching the fundamentals of computer science in a simplified way 
            comprehendable by children. We created easy to follow descriptions in each lesson, along 
            with different methods of practicing what you just learned! Our website is an easy to learn 
            destination for the fundamentals of Computer Science.
