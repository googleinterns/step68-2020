        <h2>Our goals:</h2>
        <p>
          Hello, and thank you for visiting ECS! ECS, or Elementary Computer Science, is a
          website we created with two very important goals in mind.
          <br><br>
          The <b>first</b> is to teach the basics of Computer Science to you, no matter how 
          young you are. Many people have never even heard about computer science until college
          , and when do they get to learn about it they are behind everyone else. We at ECS 
          believe that is unfair. 
          <br><br>
          Our <b>second</b> goal is to make this website easy to understand and learn 
          from. We want to motivate as many people with a computer science interest as we can. 
          Any child, no matter where they come from, should have an equal chance to learn and 
          practice computer science!
        </p>
        <hr>
        <h2>Achieving them:</h2>
        <p>
          We designed this website to be completely free and designed for everyone. In the 
          creation of this site, we always remembered our two goals.
          <br><br>
          To reach our <b>first</b> goal we created content-specific lesson plans. These plans
          will break down the basics of computer science piece by piece in a simple way. Through
          our easy to follow instructions and our different methods of practicing what you just 
          learned, we will be able to make computer science understandable to children! So, our
          website is an easy place for everyone to learn the fundamentals of computer science.
          <br><br>
          To reach our <b>second</b> goal we created a lesson plan in English, but by using 
          computer science we were able to create lesson plans in other languages as well. 
          This means that children from all over the world and children with English as their 
          second language will not only be able to use the site, but also ask for help from 
          their parents when they don't understand a concept. Although their parents may not 
          know computer science, we designed this webste to be easily understandable by all! 
        </p>
        <hr>
        <h2>Who are we?</h2>
        <h3>We are just three college students</h3>
        <p>
          This entire website, from scratch to finish, was constructed by three college students
          still earning their degree. We all interned for Google and were designated a team.
          <br><br>
          We created this specific website because we want everyone to <b>succeed</b>. We want 
          to help the less fortunate who may not have a computer science program at their school, 
          or those who do but struggle due to a language barrier. We believe anyone with an 
          interest deserves the right to fight for it.
          <br><br>

        <h3>Meet the Team:</h3>
        <h4>Sean Sanchez</h4>
        <p>
          Hi, my name is Sean Sanchez and I am a first generation rising junior at Cornell 
          University. I was born and raised on Long Island, NY, but my family is from and 
          lives in Peru.
          <br><br>
          This website was a special project for me because if I hadn't gone to Cornell, I 
          wouldn't be doing computer science. This is scary because I can't imagine myself 
          doing anything else. I created this website so that even those children with no 
          computer science exposure prior to college can find their passion and get a head
          start. I also wanted to help increase the minority population in the tech industry
          and for that reason I worked on making this website accessible in different languages.
          <br><br>
          I believe that everyone deserves an equal opportunity to find their own path in life,
          and this website is my way of creating that equal playing field for some people to find
          theirs.

        <h4>Praful Sigdel</h4>
        <p>
          Hello, I am Praful Sigdel. I am a rising junior pursuing Physics and 
          Computer Science at Fisk University. I love writing codes, building robots, and teaching Math, Physics, and CS.
          Besides school work and personal project, I can be found playing piano or guitar in solitude. I
          love reading books. Philosophy, psychology, and non-fiction interests me to a great extent.
          I have told you about my academics and interests associated with it in the above lines. On the morality side of
          my personality traits, I am not trying to create a frankenstein's monster in my life. 
          Motivation to start: I didn't see a computer until I was in my 6th grade and didn't write code until I graduated
          high school. Happy reading and coding!
        </p>

        <h4>Jamie Tucker</h4>
        <p>Hello! My name is Jamie Tucker (Pronouns: he/him/his) and I am a Black rising Sophomore at The Ohio State University.
          I'm currently majoring in Computer Science Engineering, 
          learning the necessary skills to become a software engineer.
        <p>I've been coding since middle school, starting with drag and drop
          programs such as Scratch. I built a couple of game projects at various
          summer camps and even a dance video!
          As I got older, I experimented with other coding websites, such as Khan Academy and Codecademy,
          to learn the basics of Java.
          During my Junior year of high school, I enrolled into a tech campus called Oakland Schools Technical Campus (OSTC),
          where I learned to build websites using HTML and CSS.
          This tech campus sparked my passion to pursue a career in Computer Science with
          their interactive engagement, fun projects, and overall supportive staff.
        <p>I want this project to be a place where kids in underrepresented communities (Black, Latinx, Native American, etc.)
          are able to learn about computer science at an earlier age than college. There is very little
          diversity in the computer science industry right now, and I want to recruit more people
          in these underrepresented communities to change that narrative!
